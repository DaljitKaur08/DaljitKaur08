#  Welcome to My GitHub Profile  

##  About Me  
Hello, my name is **Daljit Kaur**, a passionate and dedicated **Software Developer student** at the **Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT)** in Winnipeg, Canada. I have always been curious about how technology works and how it can make everyday life easier. At MITT, I’m developing strong skills in programming, version control, and software design through a hands-on and organized approach. Before starting my Software Developer program, I studied **Applied Business Management (ABM)** at the **University of Manitoba**, where I learned the value of discipline, research, and continuous learning.  

Before moving into software development, I worked as a **Physics teacher** in India. That experience built my confidence in leadership, teamwork, and communication, and taught me to explain complex ideas in simple ways — a skill that now helps me debug code and collaborate effectively. I’m passionate about **coding and problem-solving**, especially when building creative projects that combine logic, design, and innovation. Learning new tools such as **Git**, **GitHub**, and **VS Code** has shown me how organization and collaboration play a major role in real-world development. My goal is to become a **professional Software or Web Developer in Canada** and contribute to building applications that make people’s lives better.

##  GitHub Stats  

As a beginner in software development, I have recently started exploring **Java**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. Creating my first GitHub repository has helped me understand how developers use Git and GitHub to save, track, and collaborate on projects. I’m gradually learning how version control supports teamwork and keeps code organized.  

These stats represent my first steps as a developer — every small commit shows my progress as I learn new tools and languages. I’m excited to continue building projects, improving my skills, and contributing to open-source in the future.

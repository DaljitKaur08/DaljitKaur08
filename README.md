# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile  

## 💫 About Me  
Hello, my name is **Daljit Kaur**, a passionate and dedicated **Software Developer student** at the **Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT)** in Winnipeg, Canada. I’ve always been curious about how technology works and how it can make everyday life easier. At MITT, I’m developing strong skills in programming, version control, and software design through a hands-on and organized approach. Before starting my Software Developer program, I studied **Applied Business Management (ABM)** at the **University of Manitoba**, where I learned the value of discipline, research, and continuous learning.  

Before moving into software development, I worked for  as a **Physics  teacher** in India. That experience built my confidence in leadership, teamwork, and communication, and taught me to explain complex ideas in simple ways — a skill that now helps me debug code and collaborate effectively. I’m passionate about **coding and problem-solving**, especially when building creative projects that combine logic, design, and innovation. Learning new tools such as **Git**, **GitHub**, and **VS Code** has shown me how organization and collaboration play a major role in real-world development. My goal is to become a **professional Software or Web Developer in Canada** and contribute to building applications that make people’s lives better.

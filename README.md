## About Me

Hello, my name is **Daljit Kaur**. I am a dedicated and motivated **Software Developer student** at the **Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT)** in Winnipeg, Canada.  I have always been curious about how technology works and how it can make our daily lives easier. My learning journey at MITT has helped me explore programming, version control, and software design in an organized and practical way.Before joining the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT), I studied at the University of Manitoba, where I enhanced my academic knowledge and learned the importance of research, discipline, and lifelong learning.I also worked  as a Physics  teacher in India. During this time, I developed strong skills in leadership, classroom management, teamwork, and communication.Because of my background in education, I always try to stay organized, manage my time well, and keep a positive attitude while learning new technologies.

I am passionate about coding and problem-solving. I enjoy creating projects that combine logic, design, and creativity.  Learning new tools such as **Git**, **GitHub**, and **VS Code** has shown me the importance of organization and version control in real-world software development.  I love exploring JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make interactive web pages and I’m currently improving my understanding of programming logic and file management through the Command Line Interface (CLI).My long-term goal is to work as a **professional web or software developer** in Canada. I aim to continue learning new technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with other developers to build useful applications.  I believe that every challenge is a learning opportunity, and with consistency and a positive attitude, growth is always possible.
